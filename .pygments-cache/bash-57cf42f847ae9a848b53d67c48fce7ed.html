<div class="highlight"><pre>Now that your realm is <span class="nb">set </span>up you may wish to create an administrative
principal using the addprinc subcommand of the kadmin.local program.
Then, this principal can be added to /etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl so that
you can use the kadmin program on other computers.  Kerberos admin
principals usually belong to a single user and end in /admin.  For
example, <span class="k">if</span> jruser is a Kerberos administrator, <span class="k">then</span> in addition to
the normal jruser principal, a jruser/admin principal should be
created.

Don<span class="err">&#39;</span>t forget to <span class="nb">set </span>up DNS information so your clients can find your
KDC and admin servers.  Doing so is documented in the administration
guide.
