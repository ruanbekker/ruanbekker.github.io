    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had to achieve a way to provide data in key-value format, where I wanted to see what sports people like, eg: <code>{"ruan": ["rugby", "cricket"]}</code></p>

<h2>The Idea</h2>

<p>So my idea was to have the <code>name</code> as the key, and the <code>sports</code> as the value in a list.</p>

<h2>Some Catches</h2>

<p>So for this post, I will be setting the data statically in the code, while at the time I was working data that was returned via a API.</p>

<p>I am looping through each occurence, adding the name, and when the name exists, I append the sport to the list of the person.</p>

<p>The catch was that, if there was any duplicated data, the person will only exists once in the dictionary that I am building, but the sport will be appended, so if there were 2 occurences of <code>rugby</code> it will show the sport 2 times. So I had to put some logic into the code to handle that.</p>

<h2>The Code</h2>

<pre><code class="python">"""|Info:

Printing Sports per Person, by looping through data, appending the sports to a list per person, which gets added to our dictionary.

Variables:
    group {dict} -- "the dictionary that we are building up"
    people {list} -- "list of people with their sport choices"
    for sportman in people: {[for-loop]} -- "iterating through our data, if the sport exists, continue, if not, apeend it to the list"
    print(group) {[dict]} -- "printing the results"
"""

group = {}
people = [
    {
        "name": "ruan", 
        "sport": "cricket"
    }, 
    {
        "name": "stefan", 
        "sport": "rugby"
    }, 
    {
        "name": "stefan", 
        "sport": "cricket"
    }, 
    {
        "name": "james", 
        "sport": "rugby"
    }, 
    {
        "name": "james", 
        "sport": "golf"
    }, 
    {
        "name": "stefan", 
        "sport": "rugby"
    }, 
    {
        "name": "james", 
        "sport": "hockey"
    }
]

for sportman in people:
    if sportman['name'] in group:
        if sportman['sport'] not in group[sportman['name']]:
            group[sportman['name']].append(sportman['sport'])
        else:
            pass
    else:
        group[sportman['name']] = []
        group[sportman['name']].append(sportman['sport'])

print(group)
</code></pre>

<h2>Running the Script:</h2>

<p>When running the script results in the following:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ python sports.py 
{'james': ['rugby', 'golf', 'hockey'], 'ruan': ['cricket'], 'stefan': ['rugby', 'cricket']}
</code></pre>
