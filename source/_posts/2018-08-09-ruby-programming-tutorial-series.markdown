Welcome! This will be a multi post ruby tutorial programming series, as I am on a mission learning ruby.

## Outline of the Series:

This may change, but the path will look like this:

- Setup, The Terminal and Variables
- Arrays
- Data Types
- Objects, Classes and Methods

All posts associated to this tutorial series will be tagged as [#ruby-tutorial-series](http://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/tags/ruby-tutorial-series)
