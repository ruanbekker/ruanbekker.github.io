## VULTR Mission

From their website, their about us section states:

"Vultr, founded in 2014, is on a mission to empower developers and businesses by simplifying the deployment of infrastructure via its advanced cloud platform. Vultr is strategically located in 16 datacenters around the globe and provides frictionless provisioning of public cloud, storage and single-tenant bare metal."

"Vultr has made it our priority to offer a standardized highly reliable high performance cloud compute environment in all of the cities we serve. Launching a cloud server environment in 16 cities around the globe has never been easier!"

## Launching a Server

I decided to deploy a server pre-configured with Docker, and just about a minute I had my server up and running with Docker, ready to go.

## Overall

I'm quite impressed with VULTR and the ease of use. The pricing is really good and like the fact that you can deploy servers with pre-configured software on it.

<script type="text/javascript">
  ( function() {
    if (window.CHITIKA === undefined) { window.CHITIKA = { 'units' : [] }; };
    var unit = {"calltype":"async[2]","publisher":"rbekker87","width":728,"height":90,"sid":"Chitika Default"};
    var placement_id = window.CHITIKA.units.length;
    window.CHITIKA.units.push(unit);
    document.write('<div id="chitikaAdBlock-' + placement_id + '"></div>');
}());
