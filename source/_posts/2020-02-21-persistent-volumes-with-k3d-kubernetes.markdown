With k3d we can mount the host to container path, and with persistent volumes we can set a hostPath for our persistent volumes. With k3d, all the nodes will be using the same volume mapping which maps back to the host.

We will test the data persistence by writing a file inside a container, kill the pod, then exec into the pod again and test if the data persisted

## The k3d Cluster

Create the directory on the host where we will persist the data:

```
> mkdir -p /tmp/k3dvol
```

Create the cluster:

```
> k3d create --name "k3d-cluster" --volume /tmp/k3dvol:/tmp/k3dvol --publish "80:80" --workers 2
> export KUBECONFIG="$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3d-cluster')"
```

Our application will be a busybox container which will keep running with a ping command, map the persistent volume to `/data` inside the pod.

Our `app.yml`

```

```

Deploy the workload:

```
> kubectl apply -f app.yml
persistentvolume/task-pv-volume created
persistentvolumeclaim/task-pv-claim created
deployment.apps/echo created
```

View the persistent volumes:

```
> kubectl get pv
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                    STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE
task-pv-volume                             1Gi        RWO            Retain           Bound    default/task-pv-claim    manual                  6s
```

View the Persistent Volume Claims:

```
> kubectl get pvc
NAME             STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
task-pv-claim    Bound    task-pv-volume                             1Gi        RWO            manual         11s
```

View the pods:

```
> kubectl get pods
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
echo-58fd7d9b6-x4rxj   1/1     Running   0          16s
```

Exec into the pod:

```
> kubectl exec -it echo-58fd7d9b6-x4rxj sh
/ # df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on

osxfs                   233.6G    139.7G     86.3G  62% /data

/dev/sda1                58.4G     36.1G     19.3G  65% /etc/resolv.conf
```

Write the hostname of the current pod to the persistent volume path:

```
/ # echo $(hostname)
echo-58fd7d9b6-x4rxj
/ # echo $(hostname) > /data/hostname.txt
/ # exit
```

Exit the pod and read the content from the host (workstation/laptop):

```
> cat /tmp/k3dvol/hostname.txt
echo-58fd7d9b6-x4rxj
```

Look at the host where the pod is running on:

```
> kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION        INTERNAL-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE   KERNEL-VERSION     CONTAINER-RUNTIME

```

Delete the pod:

```
> kubectl delete pod/echo-58fd7d9b6-x4rxj
pod "echo-58fd7d9b6-x4rxj" deleted
```

Wait until the pod is rescheduled again and verify if the pod is running on a different node:

```
> kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP          NODE                       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
echo-58fd7d9b6-fkvbs   1/1     Running   0          35s   10.42.2.9   k3d-k3d-cluster-worker-1   <none>           <none>
```

Exec into the new pod:

```
> kubectl exec -it echo-58fd7d9b6-fkvbs sh
```

View if the data is persisted:

```
/ # hostname
echo-58fd7d9b6-fkvbs

/ # cat /data/hostname.txt
echo-58fd7d9b6-x4rxj
```
